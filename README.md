**nefarious is a web application that helps you download Movies and TV Shows.**

It aims to combine features of [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/), [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) and [Ombi](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi).

It uses [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/) and [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) under the hood.  Jackett searches for torrents and Transmission does the downloading.

Features:
- [x] Search TV & Movies
- [x] Auto download TV (individual episodes or full season)
- [x] Auto download Movies
- [x] Discover TV & Movies (by popularity, genres, year etc)
- [x] Find similar TV & Movies
- [x] Find recommended TV & Movies
- [x] Manually search jackett's torrent results and download
- [x] Supports blacklisting torrent results (i.e avoid a bad/fake torrent that should be avoided)
- [X] Supports quality profiles (i.e only download *1080p* Movies and *any* quality TV)
- [x] Supports whether to download media with hardcoded subtitles or not
- [x] Supports user defined keywords to filter results (i.e ignore "x265", "hevc" codecs)
- [x] Auto download TV & Movies once it's released (routinely scan)
- [x] Monitor transmission results & status from within the app
- [x] Self/auto updating application
- [x] Supports multiple users and permission groups (i.e admin users and regular users)
- [x] Responsive Design (looks great on desktops, tablets and small devices like phones)
- [x] Movie trailers
- [x] Automatically renames media
- [x] Supports multiple languages (TMDB supports internationalized Titles, Descriptions and Poster artwork)
- [ ] Support user requests (i.e an unprivileged user must "request" to watch something)

### Dependencies

nefarious is best run via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) through [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Install those two programs and you're all set. If your OS isn't listed in the Docker downloads, see the OS specific instructions below.

#### OS specific dependencies

Follow some guidelines for installing Docker and Docker Compose for various OS's.

##### Arch

You should be able to install docker and docker-compose from the default Software Center/repositories.

##### Solus OS

You should be able to install docker and docker-compose from the default Software Center/repositories.

##### Ubuntu/Debian

Ensure that git and curl are already installed, then run the following commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
    # this commands refers to the current latest docker compose version of 1.18.0.  See latest versions at https://github.com/docker/compose/releases
    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.18.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

##### Fedora

Install the Docker repository and update metadata cache

    sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
    sudo dnf makecache

Install docker and docker-compose from repository

    sudo dnf install docker-ce
    sudo dnf -y install docker-compose

At the moment Docker-Compose doesn't fully work without modification on Fedora 31.  30,29,28, and so on should work however.  If you're running Fedora 31, use the following Reddit thread and most recent post at your own discretion. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/d8ukd0/has_anyone_managed_to_run_docker_ce_on_fedora_31/

##### Windows

You'll need to ensure that your PC is running a version of Windows 10 64-bit Professional, Education, or Enterprise.
Docker for Windows requires Hyper-V technology, which is not supported by Windows 10 Home.
You'll also need to ensure that your PC has Virtualization enabled in BIOS before attempting to install Docker for Windows.
While nefarious is not by any means a Linux exclusive application, it is much easier to setup on either a Linux based OS, or on a Linux Virtual Machine through your preferred VM software on any actively updated version of Windows.
Consult appropriate documentation relating to said software if you wish to setup folder shares between your Linux VM and your Windows install.  Docker Toolbox is also an option, as it runs docker commands on non-Hyper-V supported OSes by running them through an integrated Linux VM.
If you'd prefer to avoid using something like Virtualbox, VMWare, or other separate Virtualization software, this would would probably work best for you.
That being said, we'd recommend this only be done by experienced users of Docker software.

### Setup

#### Part 1 - Setup performed from terminal

Run the following commands:
    
    sudo systemctl start docker.service
    sudo systemctl enable docker.service
    sudo groupadd -f docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker

This will:

- verify docker is initialized
- add current user to the docker group
- update the current shell session to use new login group

You'll now be able to run Docker commands without needing to call `sudo` each time.

Ensure that Docker is setup correctly.  Run the following command which should respond with "success":

    docker run --rm -it --init alpine echo "success"
    
Ensure that docker-compose is setup correctly.  This shows the version of docker-compose currently installed on the system:

    docker-compose --version
    
Clone the nefarious repository and start all the Docker containers:

    git clone https://github.com/lardbit/nefarious.git
    cd nefarious
    docker-compose up -d

Your default local addresses for the various services will be:

- nefarious: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Jackett: [http://localhost:9117](http://localhost:9117)
- Transmission: [http://localhost:9091](http://localhost:9091)

**NOTE:** See *Part 2* for finalizing the configuration.

##### ARM devices

For those running ARM devices like the raspberry pi, odroid, pine etc: 

You will need to reference the `docker-compose.arm.yml` file when running docker commands instead of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

For example, run the following to bring up all the services on ARM devices: 
    
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.arm.yml up -d

### Part 2 - Setup performed from GUI or text editor

The default nefarious user/password is `admin`/`admin`.  On first login you will be directed to the main nefarious settings and asked to configure your Jackett API token.
Jackett's host in the main settings should remain `jackett` and the port should remain `9117`.  Copy your API Token from [Jackett](http://localhost:9117) into the appropriate nefarious section.
Don't forget to also add some indexers in Jackett to track your preferred content, and be sure to test them to see that they're working.  Some popular examples are *The Pirate Bay*, *1337x*, *RARBG*.

Transmission's host should remain `transmission` and port should remain `9091`.  It's possible to configure it with a username and password, but defaults to keeping them both blank.
Entering both username and password in the nefarious settings should only be done if the Transmission settings of 'transmission-settings.json' were also configured for your desired user/pass.
The Download Subdirectories can also be configured here as well.  Bear in mind these are subdirectories, and that we will be configuring the parent download directory shortly.
Leaving these as they are will be perfectly fine.  

Global Language, Keyword Exclusions, Subtitles, and Picture Quality can also be configured here.
TV and Movie quality profiles can be changed independently of each other if you wish to have differing profiles.
Finally, user accounts and passwords can be added or modified as well.  Feel free to change the defaults now if you so desire, or add additional users on your PC/system.
Once all of your Settings are to your preference, first click `Save` then be sure to `Verify Settings`.

#### Transmission Configuration

In order to change the download folder (which is set to `/tmp/transmission` by default) look for the `docker-compose.yml` file in your nefarious folder and edit 

    /tmp/transmission:/downloads

to be like

    /Your/Desired/Folder:/downloads
  
Leave the right side alone and only change the left side.  The structure of the folder path is the same for both Linux and Windows.
Once you've made your changes, save your `docker-compose.yml` file, open a terminal to your nefarious folder and type 

    docker-compose up -d

to update and apply your updates.

There is no default transmission user/pass, but feel free to edit the `transmission-settings.json` beforehand following the [official settings](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/wiki/Editing-Configuration-Files) to make any changes you'd like.

**NOTE** if you make any changes to `transmission-settings.json` you'll have to recreate the transmission container for the changes to take place:

    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate transmission

### Troubleshooting
   
    # logs for main app
    docker-compose logs -f nefarious

    # logs for tasks (search results)
    docker-compose logs -f celery

    # list all services (they should all be "up")
    docker-compose ps

    # use a hammer and restart everything (you won't lose your settings, though)
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d


### Development

If you're interested in contributing or simply want to run nefarious without *docker* then follow these instructions.

nefarious is built on:

- Python 3.8
- Django 3
- Angular 6
- Bootstrap 4

*Note*: Review the `Dockerfile` for all necessary dependencies.

#### Install python dependencies

This assumes you're either installing these packages in your global python environment (in which case you probably need to use `sudo`) or, even better, install a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) first.
  
    pip install -r src/requirements.txt

#### Build database
  
    python src/manage.py migrate

#### Run nefarious init script

This creates a default user and pass (admin/admin).

    python src/manage.py nefarious-init admin admin@localhost admin


#### Build front-end resources

First install the frontend dependencies:

    npm --prefix src/frontend install

Then build the frontend html/css stuff (angular):
    
    npm --prefix src/frontend run build
   
Note: run `npm --prefix src/frontend run watch` to automatically rebuild while you're developing the frontend stuff.
   
#### Run nefarious

##### Basic development server

This method is the default Django development server but doesn't support websockets.

    DEBUG=1 python src/manage.py runserver 8000
   
It'll be now running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

*NOTE: this method won't support websockets*

##### Development server with websockets

This method runs the production server (with hot reload) and supports websockets.

    python src/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    DEBUG=1 uvicorn nefarious.asgi:application --reload
    
It'll be now running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
   
#### Run celery (task queue)

[Celery](http://celeryproject.org) is a task queue and is used by nefarious to queue downloads, monitor for things, etc.

Run the celery server:

    cd src
    DEBUG=1 WEBSOCKET_HOST=ws://localhost:8000/ws celery -A nefarious worker --loglevel=INFO
    
You'll see all download logs/activity come out of here.

**NOTE**: By prefixing `DEBUG=1` before the celery command, all torrents will start as **paused** to avoid downloading anything.

#### Dependencies

Jackett, Redis and Transmission are expected to be running somewhere.  

You can download and run them manually, or, for simplicity, I'd just run them via docker using the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Run redis, jackett and transmission from the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    docker-compose up -d redis jackett transmission
